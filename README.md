# DSA with JavaScript
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with JavaScript involves a structured approach. Here's a detailed roadmap to help you navigate through the key concepts and techniques:

### 1. **Foundations**

**JavaScript Basics:**
- Understand variables, data types, operators, and control structures (if-else, loops).
- Functions, scope, and closures.
- ES6+ features: let/const, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators.

**Basic Data Structures:**
- Arrays and Strings.
- Objects and Maps.

### 2. **Core Data Structures**

**Linear Data Structures:**
- **Arrays:** Basic operations, multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Linked Lists:** Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks:** LIFO principle, stack operations.
- **Queues:** FIFO principle, circular queue, priority queue.

**Non-Linear Data Structures:**
- **Trees:** Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, red-black trees.
- **Heaps:** Min-heap, max-heap.
- **Graphs:** Representations (adjacency list, adjacency matrix), types of graphs (directed, undirected, weighted, unweighted).

### 3. **Advanced Data Structures**

**Hashing:**
- Hash tables, hash functions, collision resolution techniques (chaining, open addressing).

**Trie:**
- Prefix trees for efficient string operations.

### 4. **Algorithms**

**Sorting Algorithms:**
- Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort.
- Merge sort, quicksort, heap sort.
- Counting sort, radix sort, bucket sort.

**Searching Algorithms:**
- Linear search, binary search.
- Search in rotated sorted array.

**Dynamic Programming:**
- Concepts of memoization and tabulation.
- Classic problems: Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, longest common subsequence.

**Greedy Algorithms:**
- Activity selection, coin change problem, Huffman coding.

**Graph Algorithms:**
- Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS).
- Shortest path algorithms: Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford.
- Minimum spanning tree algorithms: Kruskal’s, Prim’s.

**Backtracking:**
- N-queens problem, subset sum, permutation and combination generation.
